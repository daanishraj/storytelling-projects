    <!-- <p>1. Make a circle change color when you hover over it.</p>
    <p>2. When you hover over a marker, make the text after "Currently selected" fill up with the country's name.</p>
    <p>3. Hide the "Currently selected" box when there's nothing being selected. It's HTML and not SVG, so instead of <strong>.attr</strong> you'll need to use a similar method called <strong>.style</strong>. You'll be setting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display">display property</a> - under "Syntax" there's a whole list of what you could set it to.</p>
    <p>4. Color the circles by continent. Use one of <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Accent&n=6">these color scales</a>. Make sure your hover still works!</p>
    <p>5. It's kind of hard to click things, size the circles based on the population of their country (be sure to use the right kind of scale for circle radii!)</p>
    <p>6. Some of the circles are now hidden since larger ones are on top of smaller ones! Make it so that smaller circles are always on top.</p>
    <p>7. Add 6 buttons, one for each continent in the data set (Asia, Europe, N. America, S. America, Africa, Oceania). When I click one of those buttons, dim out the circles not in that country.</p>
    <p>8. Add a button called called "Small countries" that only shows countries with a population less than 10 million. Make a button called "No tiny countries" that hides all countries with population less than 5 million</p>
    <p>9. Right now the axes are 0-100 years and 0-$100,000 per capita GDP. Change it be based on the data once you've read in in (just the tops - I think 0 is a good base for GDP and life expectancy).</p>
    <p>10. When I click those continent buttons I want to zoom in on the elements from that continent.</p>
    <p>BONUS! Add a title and axis labels.</p>
    <p>BONUS! Add more information in the "Currently selected" hover box.</p> -->
