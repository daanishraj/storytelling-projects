# storytelling-final-project
Stephanie Doctor, Amla Srivastava, and Daanish Raj - Final project for Storytelling with Data, Fall 2016.

Created several interactive visualizations to explore character networks and interactions across scenes in the popular Hollywood movie 'Love Actually'. The movie script was parsed using R and infographics were created using D3.js, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
